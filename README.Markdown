# XFN Discovery

A [Greasemonky](http://github.com/georgebrock/XFN-Profile-Detection/) script to help you find your friends' profiles.  Built at [Open Hack London 2009](http://openhacklondon.pbworks.com/)

### Installation
If you have Greasemonkey installed, just go to this URL: [georgebrock.com/openhack2009/xfndiscovery.user.js](http://georgebrock.com/openhack2009/xfndiscovery.user.js)

### Usage
Once the user script is installed, when you visit a page that contains any `rel=me` links (a Twitter profile, for example) a link will appear in the top left corner of the page that gives you access to any other profiles the user might have online.

### Greasekit

There is a Greasemonkey-like plugin for Safari called Greasekit.  Unfortunately this plugin isn't currently compatible with Greasekit.  It might be one day, but no promises.
